        I married my beautiful wife Jamie in May of 2023 and we currently live in Lehi, UT. We like to have fun year round.
        We often ride bikes on and off road, we like to go Skiing and Fourwheeling. Pretty much anything that gets us outside and active!
        When I'm not outside I enjoy learning new skills, reading, and painting.`
